Project Reflections:

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

The problem for this course project was the academic advisors of the computer science department for the fictional university "ABCU" required
a program that can properly load course information from a specified file into the chosen data structure(I went with a hashtable) and then
output the contents in a meaningful way to the user. A interactive menu was to be implimented allowing a user to choose different functionalities
such as loading the data structure, printing all contents, searching for specific courses and info, and of course exiting the program.


**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

Data structures are important to understand because it allows for data to be stored in a effcient organized manner 
as well as making the information easier to access and change as needed. That being said, in order to achieve this 
in the program it was important to meticulously break every part down to its most raw form of logic and slowly 
build it from there. for example, I started with the C++ libraries determining which ones made the most sense 
like <Vector> or <list> which would be needed for a hashtable to properly work. 

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

To begin, there were a number of roadblocks I encountered during my journey through this class. A few examples include understanding some of the 
more complex concepts like time complexity and big O notation, revisiting C++, writing sensible pseudocode, and getting the file to load into the program
as well as getting the different blocks to work together.

To overcome these obstacles, I attribute most of it to putting in time. As someone with ADHD I often find myself loosing track of it and end up putting 
in a large amount of hours into understanding or getting something to work, the reverse is also true however, where it becomes frustrating if something 
doesnt immediately click. This is where ive had luck with utilizing resources, whether it be what the instructor provides or things like youtube, personal textbooks, 
or my favorite, using a code visualizer which helps to show what a line of code does and how it behaves in a runtime setting. Of course, its not limited to these, trial 
and error played a large part where i had to change things up several times or just see if somthing caused an error. Also being able to build off somthing like pseudocode 
 or prior assignments helped to provide a jumping off point to certain code sections.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

I would say that this particular project expanded on the idea that there is always a way or better way of doing something as well as introducing me to
some new things. for example, using range based loops(auto&) for the hashtable data structure. Before this class ive never used them or these types of data structures
(specifically hashtables and trees) in general, i could have [i] looped through everything i suppose but after seeing them used previously and here I will apply them 
more often in the future.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

This project and all of its supporting pseudocode really helped evolve the readability of my programs. for example, while not actual code, there were a few
times where I was simpley laying out the pseudocode in a centered format without really considering how hard it makes for it to read. When making the revisions to these
documents it really helped influence me to be meticulous about the real programs structure. Obviously, you cant center code like in a word document but there were a few
times where my lines were skewed too far to the left or the right within their blocks making it difficult to determine what loops some line were a part of. As far as 
maintainability and adaptability, I made sure to include a hearty amount of in-line comments explaining the functionality and included seperate functions to perform within
specific options(search, printall, insert) that way if somebody(me) wanted to make changes Not only would understand what it does but can do it in a way that doesnt completely 
disable its fucntionality.
